The true MSE of each model could differ! Our analysis so far did not capture this.\n",

    "2. For `i` from 1 to `k`:\n",
    "   - Set aside fold `Fi` as the validation set, and combine the remaining `k-1` folds to form a training set.\n",
    "   - Train the model `M` using `ML_Algo` on the `k-1` training folds.\n",
    "   - Evaluate the performance of model `M` on the validation fold `Fi`. Store the performance metric `P_i`.\n",
    "3. Calculate the average of the performance metrics: `Average_Performance = mean(P_1, P_2, ..., P_k)`.\n",
    "4. Optionally, calculate other statistics (like standard deviation or standard error) of the performance metrics across the folds.\n",
