    "#### Train/Test Splits\n",
    "\n",
    "To accurately assess a model's performance, we need to test it on data that it hasn't seen during training. This is where **train/test splits** come into play.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Training Set**: A subset of the data used to train the model. The model learns to make predictions based on this data.\n",
    "- **Testing Set**: A separate subset used to evaluate the model. This set is not used during training and thus provides an unbiased evaluation of the model's performance on new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "By splitting our data into these two sets, we can train our model on one portion and then test its predictions on another, unseen portion. This approach gives us a more realistic measure of how well our model will perform in real-world scenarios, where it encounters data it hasn't seen before.\n",
    "\n",
    "This raises the question: If we have `data_size` points (rows), how many should we use for training and how many for testing?\n",
    "\n",
    "- If we use too much for training, our evaluation will have high variance (it will not be reliable).\n",
    "- If we use too little for training, the models we learn will not perform well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although there is some research studying how to split data into training and testing sets, the *vast* majority of the time people pick a split like 50/50, 60/40, 40/60, 80/20, 20/80, etc. based on their intuition about how much data their algorithm needs to produce a good model and how much data will be needed for evaluation. Let's use 80% of our data for training and 20% for testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question**: If we take the first X% for training and the last (100-X)% for testing, what's something we should watch out for in real applications?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**: Sometimes data sets are provided in some sort of order. For example, the student data could be sorted by GPA. We don't want to put all of the high-GPA points into training and the low-GPA points into testing, since that would also bias our evaluation. We therefore randomly select which points go into the training and testing sets. We will use the `train_test_split` function from scikit-learn which does this for us (when `shuffle=True`)."

    "**Question**: These errors seem bigger than expected based on our evaluation. What are we doing wrong?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**: We are computing the mean error (or average error), which lets positive and negative errors cancel out! This measures whether we are on average over-predicting or under-predicting. We are (on average) under-predicting by a slight amount.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several alternative metrics that can better quantify the accuracy of a model for a regression problem. We review four of the most common:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mean Squared Error (MSE)\n",
    "\n",
    "MSE measures the average of the squares of the errors. It gives a higher weight to larger errors, making it sensitive to outliers. It's useful when large errors are particularly undesirable.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\operatorname{MSE}=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i-\\hat y_i)^2,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $n$ is the size of the testing set, $y_i$ is the $i^\\text{th}$ label, and $\\hat y_i$ is the $i^\\text{th}$ prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)\n",
    "\n",
    "RMSE is the square root of MSE. It has the same units as the target variable (the same scale), making  it easier to interpret. Like MSE, it gives more weight to larger errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\operatorname{RMSE}=\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i-\\hat y_i)^2}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mean Absolute Error (MAE)\n",
    "MAE measures the average magnitude of the errors in a set of predictions, without considering their sign. It's less sensitive to outliers compared to MSE and RMSE (this can be a good thing or a bad thing, depending on your application).\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\operatorname{MAE}=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n \\left \\vert y_i - \\hat y_i \\right \\vert.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### R-squared ($R^2$)\n",
    "\n",
    "R-squared, or the *coefficient of determination*, indicates the proportion of the variance of the dependent variable (labels) that is predictable from the independent variables (predictions). Unlike the other metrics, a higher $R^2$ indicates a better fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$R^2=1-\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i-\\hat y_i)^2}{\\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \\bar y)^2},$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\bar y = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n y_i$ is the average label. In this equation the numerator measures the unexplained variance by the model and the denominator measures the total variance in the actual labels.\n",
