    "Before creating and coding up our first ML algorithms, let's review a general framework for implementing ML algorithms. Specifically, we will consider a form for defining ML algorithms that is compatible with scikit-learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "This framework relies on the term **model**. In ML, a model is a mechanism with the following abilities.\n",
    "1. It can be initialized using data. This step is sometimes called \"**training** the model using the data\" or \"**fitting** the model to the data\". During this training phase the algorithm processes the provided data to pre-compute values that will be useful for making future predictions.\n",
    "2. It can be given a query (one or more sets of input features), and it will produce predictions of the labels for the provided inputs. When the model makes a prediction, we say that the model is **run** or **executed**.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will follow the scikit-learn template for representing models and ML algorithms. Creating a new ML algorithm means implementing the following functions:\n",
    "1. `__init__`: A constructor that can be used to set hyperparameters that change the behavior of the algorithm.\n",
    "2. `fit(self, X, y)`: The function for fitting the model to the data (training the model given the data). This function is called to allow the ML algorithm to pre-process the data so that it can more quickly respond to future queries.\n",
    "    - `X`: A 2D array-like structure (e.g., DataFrame) representing the features. Each row is a point and each column is a feature.\n",
    "    - `y`: A 1D array-like structure (e.g., Series) representing the target values.\n",
    "    - **Returns**: This function returns `self` to simplify chaining together operations.\n",
    "3. `predict(self, X)`: The function for producing predictions given queries.\n",
    "    - `X`: A 2D array-like structure representing the data for which predictions are to be made. Each row in `X` is a sample, and each column is a feature.\n",
