    "**Assigned**: April 10, 2024. **Due**: April 22, 2024 at 2:00pm Eastern. **Note**: Submissions received after 2:00pm Eastern on April 29, 2024 will receive no credit.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Submitting**: Upload your submission on Gradescope as a `.pdf`. Converting to a PDF can be a complicated process, and so we encourage you to test this process well in advance of the submission deadlines. We recommend converting to HTML, opening the HTML file in a browser, and then printing or exporting to a PDF from your browser. We do not recommend directly converting to a PDF, since this requires installing xelatex. To convert to HTML in VSCode, press `ctrl+shift+p` and type `export`, and you should see an option to export to HTML.\n",

    "**Note**: Keep your `.ipynb` file, as we may request it directly (via email).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: When converting to a PDF file, ensure that all of your code cells have been executed. The results of these executions *must* be included in your submitted PDF."

Do **not** modify the <font color=\"green\">green</font> text. Try to answer the questions without consulting your notes or any online material. If you cannot, then consult your notes, and if absolutely necessary, consult course materials (slides, notebooks) and/or Wikipedia. Do **not** use other sources or tools like ChatGPT. Complete this part of the assignment on your own (do **not** work with others).\n",

    "After you have completed all of the questions, at the bottom of this assignment you will find a link to another notebook, `Homework 4 Solutions.ipynb`. This contains the solutions, and instructions for ensuring that your answers are correct and sufficient. Make another pass through your homework assignment, replacing the <font color=\"green\">green</font> text with descriptions of what you missed for each question, and providing the fixes necessary to make your answer correct. **The solutions file may include additional instructions, which may include additional content to respond to even if you got a question correct (e.g., additional reflection).** During this second stage where you are filling in your answers, replacing the <font color=\"green\">green</font> text, you may reference the solutions, work with others, and use any tools (including ChatGPT).\n",
    "\n",
    "You will only submit this assignment once after replacing both the blue and green text. You do not need to submit the assignment between the first and second passes. Grading for each question will be based on whether you followed this process, and arrived at the correct answers and have sufficient discussion/text in the end. Points will be deducted if you did not make a reasonable effort to answer the question initially, if your final answer remains incorrect, of if your answers were not sufficiently clear (so, write in full sentences with proper punctuation, and conveying your arguments clearly). Other than verifying that you made a reasonable initial effort for your initial answers (<font color=\"blue\">blue</font>), points will **not** be deducted due to *initial* answers being incorrect. Hence, there is no reason to break the rules to obtain correct answers initially."
